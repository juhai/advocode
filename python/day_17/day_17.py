# Ideas
# Keep track of the points that are active.
# For each iteration:
# 1. Find neighbouring points for each active point
# 2. Check if the points found change state + the currently active nodes.

# If a cube is active and exactly 2 or 3 of its neighbors are also active,
# the cube remains active. Otherwise, the cube becomes inactive.

# If a cube is inactive but exactly 3 of its neighbors are activÂ§e,
# the cube becomes active. Otherwise, the cube remains inactive.
